Tseczka-Wordpress-Theme
=======================

Basic wordpress theme meant for rapid and fully featured development.

FAQ
===========

## Why Tseczka ##
It’s sim­ple and removes the bloat other themes add on for the sake of hav­ing “all of the fea­tures”. If you’re look­ing for a “jump­start” theme you can copy/paste from into your own theme, to use as a ref­er­ence while build­ing your site, or to use entirely run your site, this one is for you!

## Will Tseczka Have All I need? ##
Nope. But that’s the point. Tseczka has a lot of the basics that you just don’t want to bother with and that will stay per­sis­tent across all your sites. We have a basic-styled lay­out, a great frame­work, some basic queries, and lots of micro­for­mat­ting to make your site appeal­ing to Google. Pick and choose what you need to feel com­fort­able start­ing with and get going!

## How About An Options Menu? ##
Not even. The options acces­si­ble via the dash­board only apply to the basic for­mat­ting of the back­ground, as Word­Press offers, and pro­vide the abil­ity to also upload a header for the ban­ner tem­plate page. This is a devel­op­ment theme meant for developers.

## WTF Is "Tseczka"? ##
It’s a strange way to spell a name of a strange “toy” pro­duced in Czech Repub­lic. The toy employs the use of sev­eral plas­tic “C’s” and “S’s” that link up together to form chains. Sim­i­lar to how this theme is meant to be mod­u­lar and “link” lots of parts together.

## Cross Browser Support? ##

You bet! I kept the IE7 users in mind and used a lay­out frame­work that sup­ports IE7. Wouldn’t want to dis­qual­ify a large chunk of audi­ence that you may be tar­get­ing, right? That’d just be plain mean. Also, Opera.

## What Makes This Theme Special? ##
I would say agility and the LACK of great fea­tures: font icons, 50 dif­fer­ent lay­out pages, mil­lions of short­codes, and so on. Why is this? Well, short­codes are great and all but add to the length and com­pli­ca­tion of the code. Lay­out pages are cool too but may be over­whelm­ing. Font icons? Add them if you need them. I’d rather not add any­thing but the basics

## Does This Work Straight Out The Box? ##
Close enough. All that needs to be done is adding a back­ground, and a line of code or two and you’re pretty much done but then you’ll have the “default” look. With just a few lines more of code, over­rid­ing some set­tings, and some intu­ition, your site will look unrec­og­niz­able from my iterations.
